<!-- 
 This default page is designed to support several defaults:
 1. Error pages generated by Spring Boot's error configuration receive
      $timestamp, $status, $error, $message as variables - see
      org.springframework.boot.actuate.web.BasicErrorController
 2. By default, error pages setup by SimpleMappingExceptionResolver receive
      $exception
 3. We have configured our SimpleMappingExceptionResolver to setup $ex
      instead, just to show it can be done.
